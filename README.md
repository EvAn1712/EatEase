# Eat Ease - Online Ordering System 

## Description 

This project is a React-based website designed to allow students to conveniently order products from the CROUS cafeteria, Eatease, without waiting in line. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for students to place orders, and an admin dashboard for managing inventory, tracking orders, and overseeing the preparation process.
